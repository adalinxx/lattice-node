# lattice-node

`lattice-node` runs one chain in the Lattice hierarchy. Lattice has one root,
**Nexus**, and every other chain is a descendant secured through merged proof of
work. A process owns exactly one chain, one durable store, one same-chain
overlay, and one private parent/child fact plane.

## Architecture at a glance

- **One process, one chain.** Run another `lattice-node` process for every child.
  A parent owns no child state or child fork-choice view.
- **Absolute chain paths.** Every path includes `Nexus` as its first component:
  `Nexus`, `Nexus/Payments`, or `Nexus/Payments/Rollups`. A path that omits
  `Nexus` is invalid. A child `directory` such as `Payments` is only the final edge
  label under a known parent.
- **Two network planes.** The public Ivy overlay carries same-chain blocks and
  content. The private hierarchy plane carries authenticated direct-parent and
  direct-child facts.
- **External mining.** The node creates templates, validates submitted work,
  persists accepted blocks, and publishes them. `lattice-mining-coordinator`
  schedules nonce ranges and external `lattice-miner` workers search them.
- **Content-addressed durability.** Each process stores protocol state in
  `state.db` and materialized content volumes in `volumes.db`.

Testing networks are ordinary child chains with testing-oriented economics and
cadence. Nexus has one genesis and no alternate network mode.

## Build and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adalinxx/lattice-node.git
cd lattice-node
swift build

# Nexus. Its default storage is ~/.lattice/chains/Nexus.
swift run lattice-node \
  --chain-path Nexus \
  --listen-port 4001 \
  --fact-listen-port 4002 \
  --rpc-port 8080

# Add same-chain peers explicitly when needed.
swift run lattice-node \
  --chain-path Nexus \
  --peer <public-key>@<host>:4001
```

RPC is intentionally loopback-only. The daemon rejects non-loopback
`--rpc-bind` values.

To run a child, configure its complete identity and immediate parent:

```bash
swift run lattice-node \
  --chain-path Nexus/Payments \
  --parent <nexus-process-public-key>@127.0.0.1:4002 \
  --listen-port 4101 \
  --fact-listen-port 4102 \
  --rpc-port 8180
```

The child starts in `awaitingGenesis`. Create a child intent on the parent,
submit the separately signed parent `GenesisAction` transaction, and mine the
parent block that commits it. The authenticated hierarchy plane then delivers
the genesis proof and activates the child. Genesis is returned as a normal
content-addressed block; there is no opaque serialized bootstrap channel.

## Mining

Run the coordinator against the Nexus loopback API and point it at the external
worker executable:

```bash
swift run lattice-mining-coordinator \
  --node http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --worker-executable .build/debug/lattice-miner \
  --workers 2
```

`lattice-miner` is deliberately a small worker. It receives one immutable
block/range assignment, searches nonces, and reports the result. It never owns
chain state, wallet keys, child topology, proofs, or publication.

## HTTP API

Each process exposes only its configured chain at the loopback address. Requests
cannot select a second chain at runtime.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | Process and chain status |
| `/v1/status` | GET | Same structured status response |
| `/v1/transactions` | POST | Submit a content-bound signed transaction |
| `/v1/mining/templates` | POST | Create Nexus work and gather direct-child candidates |
| `/v1/mining/work` | POST | Submit a nonce for issued work |
| `/v1/children/intents` | POST | Build a direct-child genesis intent |

See [docs/rpc-api.md](docs/rpc-api.md) for request and response shapes.

## Nexus genesis

Nexus has one deterministic, unsigned genesis exception. Its sole transaction
credits the premine and is valid only at the exact pinned genesis CID:

`bafyreiayw4z5qz4lt2sljf2enzn7uol3qa6bebadav7qwnqz7agxkiuwhq`

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| Owner public key | `ed01fe416588df6e7fa5213c0d3e430f504bb5203172120c86b874826b55f53bdb7d` |
| Timestamp | `0` |
| Target | `UInt256.max` |
| Target block time | `3,600,000 ms` |
| Initial reward | `1,048,576` |
| Halving interval | `876,600` blocks |
| Premine | `175,320` reward-block equivalents |
| Retarget window | `120` blocks |
| Maximum transactions | `5,000` per block |
| Maximum state growth | `3,000,000` bytes per block |
| Maximum block size | `1,000,000` bytes |

All other transactions, including ordinary child-genesis transactions and the
parent transaction that anchors a child, follow normal signature rules.

## Storage migration

The new store is intentionally incompatible with legacy node data. Stop the
process and remove the **entire configured storage directory**, including both
`state.db` and `volumes.db`; do not retain a legacy database or content volume.
On the next Nexus start, the node recreates the exact pinned genesis above.

```bash
rm -rf /var/lib/lattice/chains/Nexus
lattice-node --chain-path Nexus \
  --data-directory /var/lib/lattice/chains/Nexus
```

Back up any identity key you intend to reuse before removing a directory, or
place it outside the storage directory and pass `--identity-key` explicitly.
