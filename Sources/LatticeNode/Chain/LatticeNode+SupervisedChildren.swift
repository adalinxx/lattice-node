// Contract 4 / Item 2 (supervised child lifecycle as a continuous reconciler).
// The child lifecycle is a durable state machine, reconciled on a loop — not a
// one-shot launcher:
//
//   DEPLOYED ─spawn─▶ RUNNING ─cookie+auth─▶ AUTHENTICATED ─register─▶ REGISTERED
//      ▲                  │                                                │
//      │            wedged > grace                          unregister-rpc │
//      │            (force restart)                                        ▼
//      └──────── re-deploy (clears detached) ◀──────────────────────── DETACHED
//
// The reconcile loop re-evaluates every non-detached deployed child each interval,
// so a child that is slow to bind RPC, hung, or that died after registration is
// eventually driven back to REGISTERED (or explicitly logged DEGRADED) without an
// operator. On a parent crash/restart a child may still be alive holding its ports,
// so each pass PROBES before spawning and adopts a live child rather than spawning a
// duplicate into occupied ports.
