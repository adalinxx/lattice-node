// ParentChainBlockExtractor: Phase 3 per-process child block extraction.
//
// A child chain node subscribes to its parent chain's P2P gossip. When a
// parent block arrives, a ChildBlockExtractor pulls the embedded child block
// out of it and applies it to the child chain.
//
// The extractor is intentionally generic: today the parent is a Lattice chain
// (Nexus contains SwapTest blocks in `block.children`), but the same mechanism
// supports any parent — including Bitcoin acting as Nexus's parent via AuxPoW
// or OP_RETURN commitments. The ChildBlockExtractor protocol is the seam.
//
// Parent graph handling: the extractor maintains a lightweight verified parent
// graph (block hashes + parent edges + work only, no state) for observed proof
// work. Changes in the parent's canonical branch never roll back child state.
// Child validity follows content-addressed proofs and same-chain ancestry.

// MARK: - ChildBlockExtractor protocol

/// Extracts a child-chain block from parent-chain block bytes by providing
/// a content-addressed sparse proof that the child block is reachable from
/// a PoW root.
///
/// The merged mining security model is:
///   1. Root: some data whose hash passes PoW (Nexus block, Bitcoin block header)
///   2. Sparse proof: a content-addressed path (CID chain) from root to leaf
///   3. Leaf: the child chain block
///
/// The extraction IS the sparse proof — following CID references from the PoW
/// root down to the child block. In cashew terms, this is a `.targeted`
/// resolution: `root.children[dir]` traverses only the required path without
/// materializing the rest of the tree. A Bitcoin implementation would traverse
/// `bitcoinHeader → coinbase → OP_RETURN → NexusCID → NexusBlock`.
///
/// Returns (childBlock, rootHash) where:
/// - childBlock: the extracted child chain block (the leaf)
/// - rootHash: hash of the PoW root (what passed target)
///   Used as `nexusHash` in `Block.validateProofOfWork(nexusHash:)`.
///   This hash propagates from the absolute root of the hierarchy — today Nexus,
///   eventually Bitcoin — to ALL levels. Mid and Stable both validate against
///   the same Bitcoin hash, not their immediate parent's hash.
