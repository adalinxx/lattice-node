# Operations

## Process model

Operate each chain as an independent service. Every invocation needs one
absolute Nexus-inclusive `--chain-path`; a non-Nexus process additionally needs
the authenticated immediate parent supplied by `--parent`.

```bash
lattice-node \
  --chain-path Nexus \
  --data-directory /var/lib/lattice/chains/Nexus \
  --identity-key /var/lib/lattice/identity/nexus.key \
  --listen-port 4001 \
  --fact-listen-port 4002 \
  --rpc-port 8080 \
  --minimum-root-work 1 \
  --minimum-peer-key-bits 0 \
  --peer <public-key>@<host>:4001
```

RPC must remain on loopback. The same-chain overlay port may be public. Expose
the hierarchy fact port only where configured direct parents and children need
it.

## Health

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

If that probe fails, read the diagnostic body from the status route:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/status
```

Important fields:

- `phase`: `active`, `awaitingGenesis` for an unbootstrapped child, or
  `awaitingParent` when a bootstrapped child does not have a complete
  inherited-work view from its live configured parent session.
- `chainPath`: the complete path owned by this process.
- `nexusGenesisCID`: must be
  `bafyreiayw4z5qz4lt2sljf2enzn7uol3qa6bebadav7qwnqz7agxkiuwhq`.
- `tipCID` and `height`: null only while a child awaits genesis.
- `revision` and `parentWorkRevision`: local consensus and completed
  immediate-parent work watermarks, useful for causal monitoring.
- `mempoolAvailable`: false when service projection failed closed; consensus
  reads remain available, but restart the node before transaction ingress or
  template construction can resume. `/health` returns HTTP 503 so container
  health checks detect this state; `/v1/status` remains readable.
- `mempoolCount`, `mempoolBytes`, and `pendingChildIntents`: bounded service
  pressure indicators.

## External mining services

Run one or more coordinators against a Nexus process. Each coordinator allocates
non-overlapping ranges to external `lattice-miner` workers and submits results
back to the node.

```bash
lattice-mining-coordinator \
  --node http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --worker-executable /usr/local/bin/lattice-miner \
  --workers 4
```

If block production stalls:

1. Confirm the Nexus node is `active`.
2. Confirm the coordinator can reach the loopback HTTP endpoint.
3. Check coordinator logs for template rejection, expired work, or worker
   failure.
4. Check the worker executable path and permissions.
5. Confirm the submitted work satisfies `--minimum-root-work` as well as at
   least one assembled chain target.

## Child chains

Start a child process before or after preparing its parent intent. It can safely
remain in `awaitingGenesis` until the parent carrier is accepted.

```bash
lattice-node \
  --chain-path Nexus/Payments \
  --parent <nexus-key>@10.0.0.10:4002 \
  --data-directory /var/lib/lattice/chains/Nexus/Payments \
  --identity-key /var/lib/lattice/identity/payments.key \
  --listen-port 4101 \
  --fact-listen-port 4102 \
  --rpc-port 8180
```

The parent endpoint is an authority boundary, not merely a bootstrap hint. Back
up the configured parent key and child process identity as operational secrets.
A same-chain peer may restore verifiable parent continuity while this endpoint
is unavailable, but it cannot make the child `active`: only the configured
parent's ordered inherited-work completion on the current authenticated session
does that. Losing the session returns the child to `awaitingParent`; mining,
work submission, child deployment, canonical publication, and inherited-work
export to descendants remain unavailable until it reconnects.

For application testing, deploy a normal child with test-oriented parameters.
Nexus retains its one pinned genesis.

## Storage and backups

One process directory contains both halves of durable state:

```text
<storage>/
  process.key   # unless --identity-key points elsewhere
  state.db
  volumes.db
```

Take `state.db` and `volumes.db` from the same stopped process. Copying or
restoring only one can leave retained-root metadata inconsistent with
materialized content.

For easier destructive recovery, keep long-lived identity keys outside the
chain storage directories and pass their paths explicitly.

## Required migration wipe

Legacy stores are intentionally incompatible with this architecture. Migration
is a whole-directory reset; there is no partial state rebuild and no supported
way to preserve legacy CAS volumes.

```bash
systemctl stop lattice-miner lattice-node

# Optional: preserve an identity only when it lives inside the directory.
install -m 600 /var/lib/lattice/chains/Nexus/process.key \
  /var/lib/lattice/identity/nexus.key

# Remove state.db, volumes.db, and every legacy artifact together.
rm -rf /var/lib/lattice/chains/Nexus

systemctl start lattice-node lattice-miner
```

An empty Nexus directory recreates the exact pinned genesis automatically. An
empty child directory returns to `awaitingGenesis` and must reacquire its
authenticated genesis link from its configured parent.

Before running a recursive removal, resolve and verify the explicit path. Never
target a home directory, workspace root, or an unresolved environment variable.

## Common failures

### `invalidNexusGenesis`

The recovered height-zero fact or store metadata does not match the pinned
Nexus CID. Stop the process and perform the whole-directory wipe above. Do not
try to replace only the genesis row or retain `volumes.db`.

### `missingMaterializedVolume`

`state.db` references a retained volume absent from `volumes.db`. Restore a
matched backup pair or wipe the entire process directory and resync.

### Child remains `awaitingGenesis`

- Verify its `--chain-path` is absolute and exactly matches the intended child.
- Verify `--parent` names the immediate parent's process key and fact port.
- Confirm the parent intent was followed by a separately signed parent
  `GenesisAction` transaction.
- Confirm the coordinator was run with `--deployment`; normal templates never
  include genesis actions.
- Confirm a parent carrier containing the matching child genesis was accepted.
- Check hierarchy-plane connectivity; an overlay peer cannot substitute for the
  configured parent fact link.

### No peers

- Check each `--peer` key, host, and overlay port.
- If `--minimum-peer-key-bits` is nonzero, confirm every required peer identity
  deliberately satisfies it. Generated process keys are accepted by the default
  value `0`.
- Confirm both peers advertise the same Nexus genesis CID, absolute chain path,
  and minimum root-work floor.

## Security

- Keep process private keys mode `0600`; startup rejects broader permissions.
- Keep RPC loopback-only. Authenticate any proxy that exposes it beyond the
  host.
- Treat `--parent` as a pinned authority configuration.
- Firewall the hierarchy plane to intended parent/child hosts where possible.
- Use distinct storage and identity paths per chain process.
