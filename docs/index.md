# Lattice Documentation

**Lattice** commits a recursive content-addressed hierarchy while each process
validates and chooses exactly one absolute chain path. The single outer root is
**Nexus**. The canonical rationale and runtime ownership live in Lattice's
[philosophy](https://github.com/adalinxx/Lattice/blob/24.0.0/docs/philosophy.md)
and [foundational architecture](https://github.com/adalinxx/Lattice/blob/24.0.0/docs/foundational-architecture.md).

> **One process, one chain.** Every process owns one absolute Nexus-inclusive
> path and a matched `state.db` + `volumes.db` durability pair. External
> `lattice-miner` workers search work issued by Nexus through the coordinator.
> Child chains provide opt-in throughput and testing networks while deciding
> validity and fork choice independently from authenticated parent evidence.
> See [Getting started](getting-started.md).

Start here, then follow the path that matches what you're doing.
