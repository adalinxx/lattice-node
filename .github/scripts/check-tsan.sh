# Self-check fixture: a deliberate data race that ThreadSanitizer must report.
#
# We previously used `DispatchQueue.concurrentPerform` with 2,000 iterations of
# `box.value += 1`. On the Linux CI container that occasionally serialized (the
# pool collapsed to effectively one worker), so the racy read-modify-write never
# actually overlapped, tsan reported no race, and the gate falsely failed
# unrelated PRs (#169, #171, #175).
#
# This version makes the race RELIABLE: it spawns several long-lived Threads that
# each spin a tight, unsynchronized read-modify-write loop over many iterations on
# the same shared mutable `box.value`. With multiple dedicated threads (not a
# work-stealing pool) hammering the same word concurrently for a sustained period,
# the accesses provably overlap and tsan deterministically flags the race.
